Requirements to develop Risk-in-a-Box
-------------------------------------

Risk-in-a-box is built in python and runs as a plugin in `QGIS
<http://qgis.org>`_.  The Graphical User Interface components are built using
`PyQt4 <http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/software/pyqt/intro>`_ and the QGIS
plugin API (useful resources: `the QGIS Python Cookbook
<http://qgis.org/pyqgis-cookbook/>`_ and `the QGIS C++ API documentation
<http://qgis.org/api/>`_).  As such it is helpful if you are familiar with these
technologies (python, Qt4, PyQt4, QGIS). In addition, the following are needed
on your machine in order to work effectively with the code base:

* git
* subversion
* pep8
* nosetests (with coverage plugin)
* python-numpy
* python-gdal
* python-sphinx
* ...


On an ubuntu system you can install these requirements using apt::

  sudo apt-get install git subversion pep8 python-nose python-coverage \
  python-gdal python-numpy python-sphinx


In some cases these dependencies may already be on your system via installation
process you followed for QGIS.

Quick Installation Guide - Developers
-------------------------------------

To develop on the plugin, you first need to copy it to your local system. If you are a developer,
the simplest way to do that is go to `~/.qgis/python/plugins` and clone risk_in_a_box from our GitHub
repository page like this::

  git clone git://github.com/AIFDR/risk_in_a_box.git  (for read only)
  git clone git@github.com:AIFDR/risk_in_a_box.git    (to commit changes)

NOTE FOR TREVOR: Temporarily, to download the test data the first time, do::
  python storage/test_io.py
(If asked for a username or password use: anonymous and <blank>)

To verify that the installation works you can run the test suite from the command line::

  make test

This will run all the regression tests and also highlight any code issues.
Note that first time the tests are run they will pull 250MB of test data from our subversion repository.

To run the plugin restart QGIS. If you wish to
an IDE for development, please refer to `this article <http://linfiniti.com/2011/12/remote-debugging-qgis-python-plugins-with-pydev/>`_
for detailed information on how you can do so.

If you wish to debug the plugin, (referring once again to the above article), make a copy
of pydevpath.txt.templ to pydevpath.txt e.g.::

  cp pydevpath.txt.templ pydevpath.txt

Then replace the path to your pydevd module as described in the above article.

.. note::

   If you are running with remote debugging enabled, be sure to start the
   PyDev debug server first before launching the Risk-in-a-box QGIS plugin
   otherwise QGIS will likely crash when it can't find the debug server.


# If you wish to run the unit tests, please make a local copy of the qgispath.txt.templ template
# and adjust the path contained in that file to match your QGIS installation path e.g.::
#
#  cp qgispath.txt.templ qgispath.txt
#
# In order to run the tests, you should install 'discover' e.g.::
#
#  sudo pip install discover
#
# Then you can run the tests (from within the risk_in_a_box toplevel directory) like this::
#
#  python -m discover

Coding Standards
================

Please observe the following coding standards when working on the codebase:

* Python style guide (PEP8): http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008
* Python documentation guide (PEP257): http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257
* Docstrings quoted with :samp:`"""`
* Simple strings in source code should be quoted with :samp:`'`
