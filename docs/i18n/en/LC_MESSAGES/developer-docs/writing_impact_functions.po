"In many cases, there is a need to tag the exposure layer with values from "

"interpolation from gridded hazard data to point data (interpolation), from "
"polygon hazard data to point data or, indeed, from polygon data to gridded "

"In this case H could be either raster or polygon vector data and E polygon "
"or point vector data. In either case the result I represents the exposure "
"data but with an additional attribute added containing the hazard level. If "
"H is polygon data, all its attributes will be transferred to I. If H is "
