"In this study, the same functional form as Allen (2009) is adopted to "
"express fatality rate as a function of intensity (see Eq. 10 in the report). "
"The Matlab built-in function (fminsearch) for  Nelder-Mead algorithm is used "
"to estimate the model parameters. The objective function (L2G norm) that is "
"minimised during the optimisation is the same as the one used by Jaiswal et "
